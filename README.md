. Key Steps to Integrate Wallet Creation
a. Obtain API Access
Register as a developer on Okto’s platform to gain access to API documentation, sandbox environments, and API keys.
b. Define the Wallet Type
Decide if the wallet will be custodial (you manage private keys) or non-custodial (users manage their private keys).
For non-custodial wallets, you’ll need to generate keys securely and share only the public address with the user.
c. Backend Integration
API Call to Create Wallet:

Use Okto’s API endpoint to generate a new wallet address for the user. Example:
json
Copy code
POST /create_wallet
{
  "user_id": "unique_user_id",
  "chain": "ethereum" // Or other blockchain supported by Okto
}
The response will return the wallet address, and in some cases, keys if it’s non-custodial.
Secure Key Management (if non-custodial):

Use secure libraries (e.g., ethers.js, web3.js) to generate keys locally.
Store private keys securely (or encourage users to back them up if not custodial).
